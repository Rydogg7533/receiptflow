# LANDING PAGE & MARKETING COPY

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Author:** Ryan (via Claude Architect)
**Executor:** Tom (OpenClaw) — Sonnet for implementation, copy provided below
**Purpose:** Conversion-focused landing pages for the platform and each tool

---

## 1. MASTER PLATFORM LANDING PAGE (Homepage)

**URL:** `/` (root — for logged-out users)
**Goal:** Explain the platform, show the tool suite, drive signups

---

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
```
Every Tool Your Business Needs.
One Platform. One Price.
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Receipts, invoices, pay stubs, expenses — all connected. 
Stop juggling 6 different apps. Start running your business from one place.
```

**CTA Button:** `Get Started Free` → /signup
**Secondary CTA:** `See Pricing` → /pricing

**Social proof line (below CTAs):**

```
(Update this number as users grow. Start with "Trusted by freelancers and small businesses" if under 50 users.)

---

### Problem Section

**Header:** `Sound familiar?`

**Three pain point cards:**

Card 1: 
```
📥 Receipts in one app
📤 Invoices in another  
📊 Expenses in a spreadsheet
💸 Paying for all three separately
```

Card 2:
```
"Wait, did that client pay?"
"Where's that receipt from March?"
"How much did I spend on software this year?"
```

Card 3:
```
Your accountant at tax time:
"I need all your receipts organized by category"
You: 😰
```

---

### Solution Section — Tool Grid

**Tool cards (grid of 6):**

---

### Integration Section

**Header:** `The magic is in the connections`

**Visual: Flow diagram showing:**
```
Scan a receipt → Expense auto-created → Category suggested → P&L updates → Tax estimate adjusts
```

**Copy:**
```
When you scan a receipt in ReceiptsFlow, an expense automatically appears in your tracker — 
pre-filled with the vendor, amount, and date. Categorize it once, and your P&L dashboard 
and tax estimates update instantly.

That's not 4 separate tools. That's one platform thinking for you.
```

---

### Pricing Preview Section

**Header:** `Simple pricing. No surprises.`

Three tiers (abbreviated — links to full /pricing page):

```
Single Tool — $9/mo
Pick any one tool. Cancel anytime.

Pro Bundle — $29/mo ★ MOST POPULAR
All tools. All connections. Everything.

Everything in Pro + 5 team members.
```

**CTA:** `Start with a free account` → /signup

### Trust / Bottom Section

```

**Final CTA:** `Get Started Free — No credit card required` → /signup

---

## 2. RECEIPTSFLOW TOOL LANDING PAGE

**URL:** `/tools/receipts` (or keep existing `/landing` and update copy)
**Goal:** Sell ReceiptsFlow specifically, drive signups, SEO for "receipt scanner" keywords

---

### Hero

**Headline:**
```
Stop Typing Receipts Into Spreadsheets
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Upload a receipt. AI extracts the vendor, date, amount, and line items. 
Export to CSV or Google Sheets in one click. That's it.
```

**CTA:** `Try It Free` → /signup
**Below CTA:** `$29/mo for unlimited scans. Cancel anytime.`

---

### How It Works (3 steps)

```
1. Upload → Drop a photo or PDF of any receipt or invoice
2. AI Extracts → Vendor, date, total, line items — pulled out automatically  
3. Export → One-click to CSV or Google Sheets. Or auto-create an expense.
```

---

### Features

```
✓ Supports PDFs, photos, JPGs, PNGs
✓ AI-powered — extracts data in seconds, not minutes
✓ Batch upload — process dozens of receipts at once
✓ Export to CSV or Google Sheets
✓ Auto-creates expenses in Expense Tracker
✓ Dark mode (because you're working at midnight, we know)
```

---

### SEO Content Block

(This section is for search engines — informational content that ranks)

**H2:** `Why Small Businesses Need a Receipt Scanner`

```
If you're a freelancer or small business owner, you probably have a drawer 
(or a folder on your phone) full of unorganized receipts. At tax time, 
you're scrambling to figure out what's deductible and what's not.

ReceiptsFlow replaces the manual process. Take a photo, upload it, and AI 
does the data entry for you. No more squinting at faded thermal paper 
trying to read the total.
```

**H2:** `How ReceiptsFlow Compares`

```
Unlike generic document scanners, ReceiptsFlow is built specifically for 
financial documents. It knows what a vendor name looks like. It knows where 
to find the total. It knows the difference between a subtotal and tax.

And because it's part of ToolSuite, your scanned receipts automatically 
become categorized expenses — something no standalone scanner does.
```

## 3. PAY STUB TOOL LANDING PAGE

**URL:** `/tools/paystubs`
**Goal:** Capture "pay stub generator" search traffic (500K+ monthly searches)

---

### Hero

**Headline:**
```
Create Professional Pay Stubs in Minutes
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Fill in the details. Preview instantly. Download a PDF.

---

### How It Works

2. Live Preview → See the pay stub update as you type
3. Download PDF → Professional format, ready to print or email
```

---

### Features

```
✓ Professional PDF output

✓ Year-to-date (YTD) totals calculated automatically

```

### SEO Content Block

**H2:** `Who Needs a Pay Stub Generator?`

```
Self-employed individuals often need pay stubs as proof of income — 
for apartment applications, car loans, or mortgage pre-approval. 
Small business owners need them for employees who aren't on a formal 
payroll system yet.

ToolSuite's Pay Stub Generator handles both cases. Enter your income 
details, and get a professional document that looks like it came from 
a Fortune 500 payroll department.
```

**H2:** `What's Included on Each Pay Stub`

```
Every pay stub includes: company details, employee information, 
earnings breakdown (regular pay, overtime, bonuses), deductions 
(federal tax, state tax, Social Security, Medicare, 401k), 
net pay, and year-to-date totals. You can customize every field.
```

Just confirm the category and move on.
```

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR TOM

### Page Structure
Each tool landing page follows the same template:
1. Hero (headline + subheadline + CTA)
2. How It Works (3 steps)
3. Features (checkmark list)
4. SEO Content (2 sections of informational copy)
5. Final CTA (signup)

### Technical Requirements
- All landing pages are **public** (no auth required) — under `(marketing)` route group
- Server-side rendered for SEO
- Each page must have proper `<title>`, `<meta description>`, and Open Graph tags
- Use semantic HTML: `<h1>` for hero headline, `<h2>` for sections
- Fast loading — minimal client-side JavaScript on marketing pages
- Mobile responsive (most traffic will be mobile from search)

### Meta Tags per Page

**Homepage:**
- Title: "ToolSuite — Business Tools for Freelancers & Small Business"
- Description: "Receipts, invoices, pay stubs, expenses — all in one connected platform. Stop juggling apps. Start at $9/mo."

**ReceiptsFlow:**
- Title: "AI Receipt Scanner — Extract Data from Receipts Automatically | ToolSuite"
- Description: "Upload receipts, AI extracts vendor, date, and amounts. Export to CSV or Google Sheets. Free to try."

**Pay Stubs:**
- Title: "Free Pay Stub Generator — Create Professional Pay Stubs Online | ToolSuite"
- Description: "Create pay stubs in minutes. Auto-calculates earnings, deductions, and YTD totals. Download PDF. 1 free stub."

**Invoices:**
- Title: "Free Invoice Generator for Freelancers | ToolSuite"
- Description: "Create and send professional invoices. Track payments. Smart line items remember your clients. Free to start."

**Expenses:**
- Title: "Expense Tracker for Small Business — Auto-Import Receipts | ToolSuite"
- Description: "Track expenses, categorize automatically, calculate tax deductions. Receipts auto-import from ReceiptsFlow."

### Design
- Consistent with platform aesthetic (dark theme, Tailwind)
- Each tool page can have a subtle accent color matching the tool's identity
- Hero sections should be visually impactful — this is where design matters most
- Use v0.dev or the frontend design skill for generating the actual components
